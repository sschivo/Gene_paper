abstract = {Recent advances in developmental biology, systems biology, and network science are converging to poise the heretofore largely empirical field of tissue engineering on the brink of a metamorphosis into a rigorous discipline based on universally accepted engineering principles of quality by design. Failure of more simplistic approaches to the manufacture of cell-based therapies has led to increasing appreciation of the need to imitate, at least to some degree, natural mechanisms that control cell fate and differentiation. The identification of many of these mechanisms, which in general are based on cell signaling pathways, is an important step in this direction. Some well-accepted empirical concepts of developmental biology, such as path-dependence, robustness, modularity, and semiautonomy of intermediate tissue forms, that appear sequentially during tissue development are starting to be incorporated in process design.},

title = {Developmental engineering: a new paradigm for the design and manufacturing of cell-based products. Part II: from genes to networks: tissue engineering from the viewpoint of systems biology and network science},
abstract = {The field of tissue engineering is moving toward a new concept of "in vitro biomimetics of in vivo tissue development." In Part I of this series, we proposed a theoretical framework integrating the concepts of developmental biology with those of process design to provide the rules for the design of biomimetic processes. We named this methodology "developmental engineering" to emphasize that it is not the tissue but the process of in vitro tissue development that has to be engineered. To formulate the process design rules in a rigorous way that will allow a computational design, we should refer to mathematical methods to model the biological process taking place in vitro. Tissue functions cannot be attributed to individual molecules but rather to complex interactions between the numerous components of a cell and interactions between cells in a tissue that form a network. For tissue engineering to advance to the level of a technologically driven discipline amenable to well-established principles of process engineering, a scientifically rigorous formulation is needed of the general design rules so that the behavior of networks of genes, proteins, or cells that govern the unfolding of developmental processes could be related to the design parameters. Now that sufficient experimental data exist to construct plausible mathematical models of many biological control circuits, explicit hypotheses can be evaluated using computational approaches to facilitate process design. Recent progress in systems biology has shown that the empirical concepts of developmental biology that we used in Part I to extract the rules of biomimetic process design can be expressed in rigorous mathematical terms. This allows the accurate characterization of manufacturing processes in tissue engineering as well as the properties of the artificial tissues themselves. In addition, network science has recently shown that the behavior of biological networks strongly depends on their topology and has developed the necessary concepts and methods to describe it, allowing therefore a deeper understanding of the behavior of networks during biomimetic processes. These advances thus open the door to a transition for tissue engineering from a substantially empirical endeavor to a technology-based discipline comparable to other branches of engineering.},

abstract ={In late puberty, estrogen decelerates bone growth by stimulating growth plate maturation. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of estrogen action using two pubertal growth plate specimens of one girl at Tanner stage B2 and Tanner stage B3. Histological analysis showed that progression of puberty coincided with characteristic morphological changes: a decrease in total growth plate height (P=0.002), height of the individual zones (P<0.001), and an increase in intercolumnar space (P<0.001). Microarray analysis of the specimens identified 394 genes (72% upregulated and 28% downregulated) that changed with the progression of puberty. Overall changes in gene expression were small (average 1.38-fold upregulated and 1.36-fold downregulated genes). The 394 genes mapped to 13 significantly changing pathways (P<0.05) associated with growth plate maturation (e.g. extracellular matrix, cell cycle, and cell death). We next scanned the upstream promoter regions of the 394 genes for the presence of evolutionarily conserved binding sites for transcription factors implicated in growth plate maturation such as estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor, ELK1, STAT5B, cyclic AMP response element (CREB), and RUNX2. High-quality motif sites for RUNX2 (87 genes), ELK1 (43 genes), and STAT5B (31 genes), but not ER, were evolutionarily conserved, indicating their functional relevance across primates. Moreover, we show that some of these sites are direct target genes of these transcription factors as shown by ChIP assays.},
